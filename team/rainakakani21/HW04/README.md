### Files affected by my changes:
profile.tsx is the only file I changed as part of this testing effort. 



### Description of my work for HW 4B:
For HW4b, I did A/B design choice testing for our app's profile page. 

I started with the design shown in before image and used this as my 'A'— my control. 

I redesigned the profile page to have a box that shows the number of friends, posts, and likes that a user has, as well as their profile picture and bio (both with the options to change). While the profile picture and the bio were present in the original version of the profile page, none of these stats were previously visible. I also left-aligned the profile picture, as this type of formatting is more common across popular social media platforms (the profile picture was originally centered). Additionally, I added a section for recent activity so the user would be able to see a collection of their own posts. Lastly, I changed the background to a linear gradient and overlayed our line art component on top to make it more interesting to the eye. 

This helped me make my final product/ variation — my 'B'.

I then had half my team use the A version and had the other half use the B version to see how they interacted with it. I wanted to see which design was more intuituve and which seemed more interesting/ better to users. The B team seemed to have a much better response, so we went with that in the end!
