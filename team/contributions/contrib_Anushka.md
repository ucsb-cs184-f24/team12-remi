This is my github contributions for the project. While it may display a low number of commits and line changes, here's a more detailed breakdown of what I have worked on this quarter and why contributions may not be a reflection of that:
I collaborated with Alex, Helen, and Peter on the home page and rendering posts for the recipes and integrating that with the database. 
Also started the first create account page to give users an opportunity to create a username, email, and password and this was later expanded to have a section for uploading a profile picture.
Aspects such as this were more collaborative which is why the GitHub contributions do not reflect it. Also, often with PR’s I’m not typically the one to merge them only approve or put up ones. 
Additionally, I worked on commenting and liking functionality with Peter, and then I integrated with the database and UI to allow users to bookmark/save posts they’re interested in. I also added a loading activity symbol on post images to show users that a post is rendering and they can expect an image to load there. I worked with Sunhu on allowing users to click the profiles or names of other users and see their profile and recent activity subject to their visibility settings. I also modified the notifications page to allow users to check profiles and all throughout the app as well. Finally, I worked on the delete post functionality with Sunhu and Alex as well as adding confirmations to remove friends on all pages.
