My main contributions to the codebase were:
- Sign in / Sign up Authentication
- Home Page Scroll Feed, allowing refresh and loading more
- New Post Banner that checks if you have new posts available
- Basic Explore Page that shows the top liked posts
- Basic searching for users
- Deleting posts under recent activity
- Showing data of a post from the database in different UI components of a Post, such as sliders, image, title, etc.

The commmit graph is accurate, but also I have a lot of lines of code / commits since I had the first few pushes to the database, and usually I would help merge PRs if they got approval. In addition to my code contributions, I also worked a lot on documentation for meetings/standups/retros and also the design document.

This is my github contributions for the project. While it may display a low number of commits and line changes, here's a more detailed breakdown of what I have worked on this quarter and why contributions may not be a reflection of that:
I collaborated with Alex, Helen, and Peter on the home page and rendering posts for the recipes and integrating that with the database. 
Also started the first create account page to give users an opportunity to create a username, email, and password and this was later expanded to have a section for uploading a profile picture.
Aspects such as this were more collaborative which is why the GitHub contributions do not reflect it. Also, often with PR’s I’m not typically the one to merge them only approve or put up ones. 
Additionally, I worked on commenting and liking functionality with Peter, and then I integrated with the database and UI to allow users to bookmark/save posts they’re interested in. I also added a loading activity symbol on post images to show users that a post is rendering and they can expect an image to load there. I worked with Sunhu on allowing users to click the profiles or names of other users and see their profile and recent activity subject to their visibility settings. I also modified the notifications page to allow users to check profiles and all throughout the app as well. Finally, I worked on the delete post functionality with Sunhu and Alex as well as adding confirmations to remove friends on all pages.

I think my contributions graph is accurate. It generally captures how many commits I made as well as when I made them over the course of our project. I think I have a lot of deletions because I reformatted a lot of our code (specifically out styling code) and got rid of code that was in our codebase but we were not using. 

Here are the main points of what I worked on:
- letting users create new posts and storing the post's associated information in the database
- letting users tag their posts with cuisine/meal-type/etc..
- profile page hamburger menu, bio section
- redesigning the profile page
- live updates for stats on profile page
- restyled add-recipe page, explore page, notifications page (I started working a lot more on UI towards the end of the project timeline)

### Contributions
I think my contributions graph is accurate, with maybe some line counts being inflated because Prettier auto-adjusted quite a lot of formatting early on. Some of the tasks I worked on throughout the quarter include:
- Tab navigation and layout.tsx files to ensure proper navigation between different stack screens
- Profile page view when you click someone's profile pic
- A lot of bug fixes that deal with Android compatability problems
- Functionality to delete posts
- Allowing users to see post images and adding a separate notifications page
- Unit testing to make sure log out functionality was successful 

**Helen Wu**  
I think the graph contri is basically accurate. 
I worked on adding friend, the explore page, making post, and adding filter function and hashtag function to explore page. 
The commited lines might be more that I did. 

**Peter Liang**  
- worked on:
* Make account and let user create unique name.
* Invite friends + notification.
* Prevent friend keep adding same person.
* Fetching recent activities for users
* Change visibility settings in the profile and reflect on posts.
* Friendlist page and remove friends.
* Notifications when user gets a like/comment.

- Also worked on some other issues with team in liveshare(bookmark, etc).

I think the graph didn't reflect the correct commits on me. Maybe due to some random issues with the commits it is not showing my commits to the codebase and some liveshare didn't reflect in commits.

- I feel like my contributions graph is decently accurate, but does not represent the non-code work I did. I was responsible for most of the initial UI design creation, and I also manually created certain assets for our app, such as custom profile pictures, our lineart baackground, and our logo.
      Figma board below for reference.

- Most of the work I did for the app was frontend styling and UI fixes. This included the main UI for the Home Page, Bookmarks, Notifications, as well as many small commits for fixing font, colors, and small styling issues.
- In other non-code contributions, I also did the voiceover and editing for our MVP video.
