## Contributions
- I feel like my contributions graph is decently accurate, but does not represent the non-code work I did. I was responsible for most of the initial UI design creation, and I also manually created certain assets for our app, such as custom profile pictures, our lineart baackground, and our logo.
      Figma board below for reference.

- Most of the work I did for the app was frontend styling and UI fixes. This included the main UI for the Home Page, Bookmarks, Notifications, as well as many small commits for fixing font, colors, and small styling issues.
- In other non-code contributions, I also did the voiceover and editing for our MVP video.
