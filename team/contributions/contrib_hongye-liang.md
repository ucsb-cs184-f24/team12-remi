- worked on:
* Make account and let user create unique name.
* Invite friends + notification.
* Prevent friend keep adding same person.
* Fetching recent activities for users
* Change visibility settings in the profile and reflect on posts.
* Friendlist page and remove friends.
* Notifications when user gets a like/comment.

- Also worked on some other issues with team in liveshare(bookmark, etc).

I think the graph didn't reflect the correct commits on me. Maybe due to some random issues with the commits it is not showing my commits to the codebase and some liveshare didn't reflect in commits.
