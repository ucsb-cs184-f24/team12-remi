### Contributions
I think my contributions graph is accurate, with maybe some line counts being inflated because Prettier auto-adjusted quite a lot of formatting early on. Some of the tasks I worked on throughout the quarter include:
- Tab navigation and layout.tsx files to ensure proper navigation between different stack screens
- Profile page view when you click someone's profile pic
- A lot of bug fixes that deal with Android compatability problems
- Functionality to delete posts
- Allowing users to see post images and adding a separate notifications page.
