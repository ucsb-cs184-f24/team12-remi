I think my contributions graph is accurate. It generally captures how many commits I made as well as when I made them over the course of our project. I think I have a lot of deletions because I reformatted a lot of our code (specifically out styling code) and got rid of code that was in our codebase but we were not using. 

Here are the main points of what I worked on:
- letting users create new posts and storing the post's associated information in the database
- letting users tag their posts with cuisine/meal-type/etc..
- profile page hamburger menu, bio section
- redesigning the profile page
- live updates for stats on profile page
- restyled add-recipe page, explore page, notifications page (I started working a lot more on UI towards the end of the project timeline)
