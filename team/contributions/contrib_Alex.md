My main contributions to the codebase were:
- Sign in / Sign up Authentication
- Home Page Scroll Feed, allowing refresh and loading more
- New Post Banner that checks if you have new posts available
- Basic Explore Page that shows the top liked posts
- Basic searching for users
- Deleting posts under recent activity
- Showing data of a post from the database in different UI components of a Post, such as sliders, image, title, etc.

The commmit graph is accurate, but also I have a lot of lines of code / commits since I had the first few pushes to the database, and usually I would help merge PRs if they got approval.
