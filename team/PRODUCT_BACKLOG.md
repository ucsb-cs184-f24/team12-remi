# Here is a summary of the MVP feedback:
- Tags list clips into the island on iPhones
- The NavBar theme should be the same as the app theme â€“ it is just white
- Functionality of profile page is not working

# These are some user stories in response to the feedback.
- As a user, I should be able to view the tags list without it clipping into unclickable / unsafe areas of the phone view.
  - [ ] Tags list should be in a SafeAreaView, and be under the iPhone island when testing
- As a user, when I navigate to different parts of the app they should share a consistent color / theme guideline.
  - [ ] Navbars on all stacks should be beige with green clickable buttons
- As a user, I should be able to check my profile picture, add a bio, and see my own posts.
  - [ ] A user should be able to click on the blank / existing profile picture, and upload their own picture
  - [ ] A user should be able to click Add Bio to change or create some text for their bio
  - [ ] A user should be able to see a scrollable view of their own posts they've created.
