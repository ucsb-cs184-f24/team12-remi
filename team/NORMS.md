Show up within 5 minutes of scheduled meeting times, and communicate in advance if going to be late or missing meetings.

Keep documentation on any changes made. 

Make sure changes are pushed first to a branch with your name and the feature name. Make a pull request and then ensure at least 2 people review it. Then, the person who made the PR can go ahead and merge the code, resolving all conflicts.

Strictly documentation updates do not need reviews

Stay on top of the work you are assigned. If you feel it is too much or too little, communicate with Scrum Master and teammates in order to redistribute workload.
