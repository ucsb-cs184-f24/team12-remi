# Date of Retrospective: 10/18/24

* Led by: Sunhu Choi
* Present: Peter Hongye Liang, Helen Qi Wu, Alex Chau, Raina Kakani, Kavi Iyer, Anushka Vijay, Sunhu Choi
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* alert everyone (ping in discord) when you put a PR up so that people can review them in a timely fashion
* github setting to delete branches after merge
* bring in the focus as soon as class starts, because we have limited dedicated group time throughout the week
* Try to make issue names clear and concise, if they repeat, add a (n of X) to show linear progress

## Retro Assessment
* For this first retrospective, we used a site called EasyRetro to set up a board of 3 columns; Start, Stop, and Continue
* Team members put their discussion points under each column, then after 5 minutes, began voting on cards they believed were important
* We discussed the cards with the most votes, giving everyone an opportunity to voice their opinions on them
* My advice to the next retro leader is to maybe change the Retro format to something besides Start, Stop, and Continue as the Stop section is tough to utilize
