# Date of Retrospective: 10/18/24

* Led by: Sunhu Choi
* Present: Peter Hongye Liang, Helen Qi Wu, Alex Chau, Raina Kakani, Kavi Iyer, Anushka Vijay, Sunhu Choi
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* alert everyone (ping in discord) when you put a PR up so that people can review them in a timely fashion
* github setting to delete branches after merge
* bring in the focus as soon as class starts, because we have limited dedicated group time throughout the week
* Try to make issue names clear and concise, if they repeat, add a (n of X) to show linear progress

## Retro Assessment

* For this first retrospective, we used a site called EasyRetro to set up a board of 3 columns; Start, Stop, and Continue
* Team members put their discussion points under each column, then after 5 minutes, began voting on cards they believed were important
* We discussed the cards with the most votes, giving everyone an opportunity to voice their opinions on them
* My advice to the next retro leader is to maybe change the Retro format to something besides Start, Stop, and Continue as the Stop section is tough to utilize

## Retro Outcome

* We tested out a new channel on Discord called "pr-reviews-and-documentation" to better inform others of any changes or progress made. Github holds some of the base information on what we did via a checklist, but doesn't have all the details that would be needed to understand the changes made at a deeper level. This channel has allowed everyone on the team the opportunity to add more information on what they did. It has been very helpful so far, and I believe it can be even better once people add more detailed informations about their PRs.
