# Date of Retrospective: 11/08/24

* Led by: Alex Chau
* Present: Peter Hongye Liang, Helen Qi Wu, Alex Chau, Raina Kakani, Kavi Iyer, Anushka Vijay, Sunhu Choi
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* Start testing code, writing unit tests for frontend and backend
* Add some issues for basic testing such as user workflows of signing up / login, and posting
* These changes should be moved to DONE, or at the very least an experimental commit is put up containing unit tests

## Retro Assessment

* We used a site called EasyRetro to set up a board of 3 columns; Start, Stop, and Continue
* Team members put their discussion points under each column, then after 5 minutes, began voting on cards they believed were important
* We discussed the cards with the most votes, giving everyone an opportunity to voice their opinions on them
* My advice to the next retro leader is to maybe change the number of votes to 4, I think this gives enough knowledge into what issues were most voted on.

## Retro Outcome

* We experimented with being more responsive and detailed in our PRs and reviews -- I believe it turned out pretty well as we started to put fleshed out PRs including images or videos of our changes and pinging everyone in a discord channel when it was put up. We still do not really delete branches after they have been merged, which is not blocking progress at all but just clutters the Github page a bit. Overall though, this experiment was successful.
