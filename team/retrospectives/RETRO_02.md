# Date of Retrospective: 11/08/24

* Led by: Alex Chau
* Present: Peter Hongye Liang, Helen Qi Wu, Alex Chau, Raina Kakani, Kavi Iyer, Anushka Vijay, Sunhu Choi
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* Before creating a branch and working on some feature or bug, make sure to create a card, any acceptance criteria, and to assign the issue to other team members if necessary. Have clear acceptance criteria on these cards, and associate/create any user stories if necessary.
* Once starting an issue, try to alert the team through Discord / during meetings to make sure we aren't working on the same issue on different branches.

## Retro Assessment

* We used a site called EasyRetro to set up a board of 3 columns; Start, Stop, and Continue
* Team members put their discussion points under each column, then after 5 minutes, began voting on cards they believed were important
* We discussed the cards with the most votes, giving everyone an opportunity to voice their opinions on them
* My advice to the next retro leader is to maybe change the number of votes to 4, I think this gives enough knowledge into what issues were most voted on.

## Retro Outcome

* We experimented with being more detailed in creating issues and cards for new features/bugs, and making sure not to work on the same issue. The outcome of this experiment was successful, as we are better documenting which features we are working on through Discord and creating cards for issues before we start actually implementing them.
