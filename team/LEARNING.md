### Peter Liang
I had a 30min crash course on react.  Happy to learn everything needed for the development.


### Qi Wu
I have some experience in React Native and Firebase. Learning Typescript and React. Looking  forward to learn a lot. I want to do more in full stack. 


### Raina Kakani
I’m not really experienced with mobile development (especially with react native). The most relevant experience I have is with Scrum/ Agile technologies and javascript front-end development from CS 156. One of my goals for this quarter is to gain more experience with full-stack development. I also particularly want to learn how to use figma. 


### Kavi Iyer
I have experience with Swift iOS development, and QA experience with Cypress and Selenium. I am particularly interested in UI/UX design and engineering. 


### Alex Chau
I have had a little bit of experience with iOS development in Swift, and more experience in full stack development with Ruby on Rails.


### Sunhu Choi
I have some small experience with Next.js, React, and React Native development, so I am a little familiar with front-end development, but still very much a newbie. I am excited to learn everything I can and create something amazing. 

### Anushka Vijay
I have some experience with iOS development and have written hello world for react native 3 years ago. I’m interested in working on full-stack and integrating frontend and backend as most of my experience is working with backend tech. Excited for this quarter!

## Benefits and challenges of React Native
### Benefits
Hot reloading helps with quicker development

Cross-platform

Popular, so there are many available resources

Similar to React which makes transitioning to React Native easier

Knowing CSS, HTML, and JS or TSX makes learning React Native framework much more simpler as it just builds on these knowledge bases.

### Challenges
lots of deprecated functions, may have to change code as RN updates (constant adjustments)

doesn’t have certain libraries and functionalities due to being cross-platform (such as Apple ScreenTime)

has to be accessed and downloaded through Expo-Go, rather than directly downloading the app
