### Peter Liang
I had a 30min crash course on react.  Happy to learn everything needed for the development.


### Qi Wu
I have some experience in React Native and Firebase. Learning Typescript and React. Looking  forward to learn a lot. I want to do more in full stack. 


### Raina Kakani
I’m not really experienced with mobile development (especially with react native). The most relevant experience I have is with Scrum/ Agile technologies and javascript front-end development from CS 156. One of my goals for this quarter is to gain more experience with full-stack development. I also particularly want to learn how to use figma. 


### Kavi Iyer
I have experience with Swift iOS development, and QA experience with Cypress and Selenium. I am particularly interested in UI/UX design and engineering. 


### Alex Chau
I have had a little bit of experience with iOS development in Swift, and more experience in full stack development with Ruby on Rails.


### Sunhu Choi
I have some small experience with Next.js, React, and React Native development, so I am a little familiar with front-end development, but still very much a newbie. I am excited to learn everything I can and create something amazing. 

### Anushka Vijay
I have some experience with iOS development and have written hello world for react native 3 years ago. I’m interested in working on full-stack and integrating frontend and backend as most of my experience is working with backend tech. Excited for this quarter!
