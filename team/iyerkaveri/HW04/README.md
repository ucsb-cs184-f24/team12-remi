This folder contains materials and description for my Create User UI changes.

### Changes made:
- background color gradient
- background lineart
- updated image selection functions
- updated image storage functions for not-yet authenticated users
- KeyboardAvoidingViews and TouchableOpacities that create a better user experience when typing into the text boxes

### Documentation
- hw04A.md contains the status quo and expected contributions from the planning phase.
- new_create shows the full new UI
- new_create_keyboard shows that the view is scrollable so you can see the bottommost textboxes even with your keyboard open

     Note: the screenshot behavior is a little odd, so the tan box at the bottom is where your keyboard actually is, and the tan area is not actually visible on the mobile device.
