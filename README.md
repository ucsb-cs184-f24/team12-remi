## Tech Stack
We will be using React Native, and using Expo Go as our deployment platform. We believe that React Native is the best tech stack option, as it allows for us to deploy an app on different platforms, allowing not only for all our team members to stay involved, but to reach a greater market. We wish to service all users who want to find recipes, post recipes, and more, without being blocked by the OS they are using. 

We believe that Remi is a recipe sharer app that has at minimum, two types of users:
- Logged in users that can look at public recipes, post recipes, and follow other users to see their private recipes
- Unauthenticated users that can look at public recipes
