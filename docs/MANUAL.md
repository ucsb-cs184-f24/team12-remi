## Intended User Audience

- People with dietary restrictions that need recipes with certain constraints (lactose-friendly, keto, etc.)
- People who are searching for recipes with time or budget constraints
- Students who would like to share and learn new recipes with their friends

## User Walkthrough

## Sign-in and Authentication
When users open the app they are directed to the sign in-page. First time users can click ‘Create Account’ to be redirected to the register page where they can select a profile picture, choose their username, and fill out their email and password. Existing users can fill out their username and password on the sign-in page. Authenticated/Signed in users will be directed to the home page.

## Home Page
Once signed in, the home page will display recipe posts the users’ friends have posted. If the user has not added friends yet or has no friends, the home page displays a notice telling the user to “Add friends to see more posts!”. 

If other users want to add you as a friend, they will send you an invite friend request which the user can find by clicking the notifications icon on the home page which has a notifications badge showing how many unread notifications the user has. This will redirect the user to notifications page  

When friends of the user post or the user adds new friends, the home page can be refreshed and will now display the recipe posts of the users’ friends. On a post,  a user can like, comment, and save posts. This will notify the poster of a comment/like as well. 

## Notifications Page
On the notifications page, the user can accept/reject a friend request as well as see notifications of likes and comments on their post.

## Add Recipe Page
A user can add recipes of their own and post this for their friends to see or for any user of the app based on their profile visibility settings. By going to the add recipe page, a user will upload a picture of their food, the name of the recipe, any notes about the recipe, and select tags such as cuisine, meal type, diet, and course. Then they will click next and be directed to the next page where on sliders they will select the price per serving, difficulty of cooking the dish, as well as the time it took. Then they can submit their recipe! 

## Profile Page
The user can go to their profile page and see their username, profile picture, friends, posts, and total likes. The user can add or edit their bio so other users can learn more about them when discovering their profile. Clicking on their number of friends will redirect them to the friends page where they can see their friends and profiles, as well as remove them. The user can also see their own posts, like and comment on their own posts, as well as delete them. 

By clicking the hamburger menu on the top right corner, the user can see their bookmarked posts, modify their profile visibility (set it to public or private), and sign out of the app!

## Explore Page
On the explore page, on the posts tab users can discover new posts from public accounts. They can search and filter based on price, difficulty, and time for recipe posts they might be interested in. This will display the top 5 most liked posts that fit their filters. They can also search by keyword or recipe content. 

They can also search for friends and other users on the app through the users tab. They can invite/remove friends as well as click the profile pictures and usernames of users to discover new users’ profiles. Finally, on the hashtags tab the user can filter posts by hashtags and see public recipe posts people have posted using those tags.
