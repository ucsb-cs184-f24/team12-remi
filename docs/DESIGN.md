All of our user authentication and other workflows, such as creating posts, comments, likes, and editing the user profile, are stored and retrieved from the Firebase Authentication and Firestore Database. The Firestore Database stores collections, namely: Posts, Comments, Bookmarks, Notifications, RemiUsers. Users are identified in our database through their uuid generated when signing up and stored in the Firebase Authentication, allowing us to keep lists of friends, notifications, etc.
